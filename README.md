# Maps-of-Lily-Ross-Taylor
One of the TIFF files attached is the file of the map of the "17 oldest rural tibes." The files is Titled: 57523.tif
The other TIFF file is the file for the "The Thirty-One Rural Tribes with Tribal Divisions Before 232 B.C." The files is Titles: 31-Rural-Tribes.tiff
The geojson and KML files are of the digitized Taylor Maps. 
The file titled "31-Rural-Tribes-v2.geojson" is the "The Thirty-One Rural Tribes with Tribal Divisions Before 232 B.C." drawn on a map with geojson. The KML file is the same, but saved as KML for things such as Google Earth. 
The other file titled, "17-Oldest-wRoads-V1.geojson" is the geojson file of the "17 oldest rural tibes," the KML file, of the same name, is also attached. 
These files are the Taylor maps, freehanded with geojson, there will most likely be human error. Feel free to download, enjoy, and change and perfect these maps. I recommend using the program vector.rocks :)
